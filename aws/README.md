### AWS S3
- s3 bucket name only accept lowercase

### AWS CloudWatch

### AWS SQS
- If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.
    - `AWS.SimpleQueueService.PurgeQueueInProgress: Only one PurgeQueue operation on ${QueueName} is allowed every 60 seconds.`
- `QueueUrl` is not `QueueName`
    - sample `QueueName`: topicA
    - sample `QueueUrl`: https://sqs.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/616879594671/topicA
    - aws provide `sqs.getQueueUrl` to get QueueUrl from QueueName  
- no way to subscribe listener,only polling to receiveMessage is supported [pull] like kafka
- [message lag] If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular ReceiveMessage response. If this happens, repeat the request.
### AWS MQ
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ, provides support for ActiveMQ versions 5.15.0, 5.15.6, 5.15.8, and 5.15.9.
