## Notes
- log4js 6.x advantages
    - has no audited security issue
    - much lighter now: ImportCost: 194 KB 

## TODO
- get away from default preference to winston
    - dev.js -> log4js, index.js -> winston.js
- use log4j to output logFile 

## Abandoned
- not to upgrade to winston 3: hard to configured to same behavior as winston 2
