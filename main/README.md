Main toolset



## Notes
- node popular [date formatter library](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-format-dates-in-javascript/)
    - we use npm `date-format` 
- request.js is deprecated, we use axios as alternative 
    - See in [Author post](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142)
      and [recommended alternatives](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3143)
- no alternative readFileSync wrapper in fsExtra

## TODO
- add koa.js support as alternative of express.js
